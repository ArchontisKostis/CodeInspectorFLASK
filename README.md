## 🚀 Overview
CodeInspector is a web app that provides software quality analysis based on hotspot prioritization.
It takes a repository URL (currently for Java projects) and generates insights on modified files, file churn, complexity, and priority for quality improvement.
The app uses Flask for web development, Bootstrap for styling, PyDriller for repository mining, and Plotly for visualizing data.
